# Eclipse Attack

Basically this works by surrounding a node that is a part of the network, pretending to be that node, and then communicating false information under the farce of representing victim(s). As such, *eclipsing* nodes that are part of the network to obfuscate connections with incoming nodes looking to join the network or gather information from it.
