# Privacy-Preserving DHTs

**TODO**
* more analogies
* refine structure
* collect research

*privacy translates to security, especially for networks that secure significant value -- therefore, from here on out, when I use privacy, it should also imply security (but context is still important*

## Planning

* short paragraph with significant links on the importance of privacy and the significance of better system design from the beginning for new systems, such as web3 technology

* blockchain is still vulnerable at the network level, and we have discovered that significant innovation must occur at the network level to make progress at the consensus and application layers

* bottlenecks and mistakes at the network level propagate through the rest of the stack

* if you lack decentralization at the network level, this influences decentralization at the consensus level and poses a real threat to the network (eclipse attacks) `=>` this has a tangible impact on security as well, thereby affecting applications built on top of the protocol
* when those applications secure millions or even billions of `insert_currency_here`, we cannot afford to make mistakes
* moreover, the vision of Web3 requires not making the same mistakes again `=>` **need to collect more evidence from talks/blog posts on the web's centralization** 


## P2P Decentralized Networks
* p2p and decentralized networks do not require a central entity which sieves through all that happens in a network

> *However, P2P designs often require many to many communication patterns and collaboration. Users in the network often work as message relayers (one of the ways for everyone to contribute with resources to the network) and need to make decisions based on their partial view of the state of the network. With such constraints, network users (or peers) need to collaborate and learn about each other’s partial view of the network state. At a higher level, these interactions often result on a lot of systemic leakage of privacy-sensitive information: what a peers knows over time may disclose what she’s been up to. Or correlating the message patterns over time of a subset of network peers may disclose what data they are consuming or serving. This information leakage is even more important because it is disclosed not to one entity as in centralised systems, but potentially to the whole network.* ~[Privacy Preserving Engineering](https://www.gpestana.com/blog/privacy-preserving-engineering/)
