# Building Blocks of TCP

TCP provides an abstraction of a reliable network running over an unreliable channel by handling
* retransmission of lost data
* **in-order delivery** (ordered bytestream)
* congestion control and avoidance
* data integrity

TCP trades accuracy of delivery for speed of transmission.

## Three-Way Handshake

All TCP connections begin with a three-way handshake. The client or the server must agree on starting packet sequence numbers (picked randomly).
1. **SYN**: client picks random sequence number `x` and sends a SYN packets (also includes TCP flags and options)
2. **SYN ACK**: server increments `x` by one, picks own random sequence number `y`, appends its own set of flags and options, and dispatches the response
3. **ACK**: client increments `x` and `y` by one and completes the handshake by dispatching the last ACK packet in the handshake.

Once the three-way handshake is complete, the application data can begin to flow between the client and the server.

The delay imposed by three-way handshake makes new TCP connections expensive to create `=>` connection reuse is a critical optimization for any application running over TCP

**TCP Fast Open (TFO)** strives to reduce the latency penalty imposed on new TCP connections. The basic improvement is that TFO allows data transfer within the SYN packet.

## Congestion Control

When IP and TCP are used together, IP gateways are vulnerable to **congestion collapse**. If the roundtrip time exceeds the maximum retransmission interval for any host, the host will send more copies of the same datagrams, thereby flooding all available buffers and leading to significant packet loss.
